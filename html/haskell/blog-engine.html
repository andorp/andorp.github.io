<h1>Blog engine in Haskell</h1>
<p>Many of my friends and workmates asked me to start a blog writing my ideas down, these entries usually are sloppy ideas with lot of references.</p>
<p>My first thing to do with the blog is to implement a very simple blog engine entirely written in Haskell, using Pandoc and Blaze with Bootstrap. I know there are many blog engines out there, I admit, those are way better than I can write by my own. The practice I follow here is to learn as many things as possible at each and every task.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/andorp/andorp.github.io/blob/master/haskell/src/Blog/Model.hs">One of the ideas here is to do an experiment with algebra and shape functor style of coding.</a></p>
<p>Other interesting thought here is the value hole in the shape functors, which resembles me somehow to the univalence axiom, but it is only a gut feeling of mine.</p>
<p>If you feel like contribute to the engine, please write an email to andor.penzes@gmail.com, and I will create a different repository for the source code, and a joint work can start.</p>
