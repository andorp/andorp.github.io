# A Categorical Manifesto

## Abstract

This paper tries to explain why and how category theory
is useful in computing science, by giving guidelines for applying seven
basic categorical concepts: category, functor, natural transformation,
limit, adjoint, colimit and comma category. Some examples, intuition,
and references are given for each concept, but completeness is not attempted.
Some additional categorical concepts and some suggestions for
further research are also mentioned. The paper concludes with some
philosophical discussion.
