# Free monad tutorial from Dan Piponi at BayHac 2014

## Resources

Recently I was looking for some CoMonad related topic, and found a very good introduction
to Free Monads by Dan Piponi. I went trough the tutorial and created a [Free.hs](https://github.com/andorp/andorp.github.io/blob/master/asset/free/Free.hs) source
file, also saved the [presentation](../../asset/free/Bayhac14.pdf). If you are interested in the full tutorial you
can check it out from [His youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGUuGL0AgYs).

## My contribution

It is useful to define the rules of an algebraic structure which can be represented
in type classes in Haskell. E.g the rules of monoids in [Free.hs](https://github.com/andorp/andorp.github.io/blob/master/asset/free/Free.hs)
file.
