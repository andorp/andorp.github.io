# CoFree meets Free from Dan Piponi

After [his](https://andorp.github.io/html/haskell/freemonad.html) talk there was a question about CoFree
structures. In [his next blog](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2014/05/cofree-meets-free.html) item he introduced
the connection between CoFree and Free structures. Going through article shed some light for me,
mainly in the topic of CoMonad. The source file [cofree.hs](https://github.com/andorp/andorp.github.io/blob/master/asset/free/cofree.hs)
can be found here.
