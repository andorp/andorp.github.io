# Blog engine in Haskell

Many of my friends and workmates asked me to start a blog writing my ideas down,
these entries usually are sloppy ideas with lot of references.

My first thing to do with the blog is to implement a very simple blog engine
entirely written in Haskell, using Pandoc and Blaze with Bootstrap. I know
there are many blog engines out there, I admit, those are way better than
I can write by my own. The practice I follow here is to learn as many
things as possible at each and every task.

[One of the ideas here is to do an experiment with algebra and
shape functor style of coding.](https://github.com/andorp/andorp.github.io/blob/master/haskell/src/Blog/Model.hs)

Other interesting thought here is the value hole in the shape
functors, which resembles me somehow to the univalence axiom,
but it is only a gut feeling of mine.

If you feel like contribute to the engine, please write an email to
andor.penzes@gmail.com, and I will create a different repository
for the source code, and a joint work can start.
