# Summary

Many of my friends and workmates asked me to start a blog writing my ideas down,
these entries usually are sloppy ideas with lot of references.

My first thing to do with the blog is to implement a very simple blog engine
entirely written in Haskell, using Pandoc and Blaze with Bootstrap. I know
there are many blog engines out there, I admit, those are way better than
I can write by my own. The practice I follow here is to learn as many
things as possible at each and every task.
